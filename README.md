# ExcelProject---NYSE

In this project, I went through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing any inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. I added a drop-down list to pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement and a financial model that forecasts out the Gross Profit and business metrics for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case, and Base case), based on historical data.
